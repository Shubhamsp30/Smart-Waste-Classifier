        Proper waste segregation is a critical step towards a sustainable future. By separating organic waste from recyclables, we can:
        - **Reduce Landfill Waste**: Organic waste can be composted to create nutrient-rich soil.
        - **Conserve Resources**: Recycling materials like plastic, glass, and metal saves energy and raw materials.
